# JS PROJECT 1 : PASSWORD GENERATOR
My web development project is a password generator that creates strong and unique passwords with just a click of a button, providing users with added security and convenience. It utilizes a customizable algorithm that takes into account the user's preferences and generates passwords that meet the highest standards of security.

This is a simple password generator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It generates a random password of 20 characters or less based on the user's input.

##Features
The password generator offers the following options for users to customize their password:

Include uppercase letters
Include lowercase letters
Include symbols
Include numbers
Users can select any combination of these options to create a unique and strong password that meets their specific needs.

##How to Use
To use the password generator, simply open the ( https://sgroshani2912.github.io/JS-PROJECT-1-PASSWORD-GENERATOR-/ ) link in your web browser. The user interface will be displayed, allowing you to select your desired password options.

Once you've selected your options, click the "Generate Password" button to create a new password. The password will be displayed in the text box above the button.

You can copy the generated password to your clipboard and use it as needed.
